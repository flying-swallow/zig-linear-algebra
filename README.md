zig-linear-algebra: a basic linear algebra library for zig
================================================

This package is a simple linear algebra library writen entirely in Zig.

This library was written for my own use, and will be extended and optimized as I need it.
It is suitable for operations on small matrices and vectors.

this library is not ready for use.

## TODO: (in this order~)

<!-- - ~~rework how precision of output types is handle for vectors~~
- ~~rework how vectors handle integer types~~
- ~~add doc comments for Vector operations~~
- ~~add more operations to Vectors~~
- decide how to handle undefined behavior (eg overflows)
- add install guide
- add usage guide
- rework how precision of output types is handle for matrices
- rework how matrices handle integer types
- add even more operations to Vectors
- Add more operations to Matrices
- Compare performance to openblas -->
