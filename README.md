bzig-blas: bad zig basic linear algebra library
================================================

This package is a simple linear algebra library writen entirely in Zig.

This library was written for my own use, and will be extended and optimized as I need it.
It is suitable for operations on small matrices and vectors.

## TODO:

- rework how precision of output types is handled
- rework how vectors and matrices handle integer types
- add doc comments
- Add more operations to Matrices
- Compare performance to openblas
